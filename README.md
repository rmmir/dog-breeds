# Dog Breeds Project Solution
The solution for the Dog Breeds challenge is being built with React.js and TypeScript using the Vite build tool which provides an out of the box setup reducing the need for manual configuration.

## How to start the application
- Clone the repository locally
- Run `npm i` to install the dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to start the app

## Future improvements
- Improve UI/UX (ex: add loading animation, infinite scrolling or pagination, 404 page, etc.)
- Add unit tests
- Use axios instead of fetch for less boilerplate when making requests + other benefits (interceptors, error handling)
